# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Introduction

This project is a web-based basic simulation of an Etch-a-Sketch toy. It's a simple yet interactive application that allows users to draw on a pixelated canvas by hovering over grid squares. This project is part of my exploration into web development, focusing on combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive web applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: Utilizes JavaScript to create a grid of squares, which form the canvas for the Etch-a-Sketch.
- **Interactive Drawing**: Implements a `mouseover` event in JavaScript, allowing squares to change color as the user hovers over them, simulating drawing.
- **Grid Size Adjustment**: Includes a feature to adjust the grid size based on user input, enhancing interactivity and user engagement.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Employed for layout design, demonstrating an understanding of modern CSS layout techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the interactive features and grid functionality.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my skills in creating an interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates my ability to integrate user input and event handling to create engaging web experiences.
